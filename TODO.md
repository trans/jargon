## Completed

### Schema Mixins with $id/$ref/allOf (v0.12.0)

Support for sharing properties across subcommands using standard JSON Schema keywords.

```yaml
---
$id: global
properties:
  verbose: {type: boolean, short: v}
  config: {type: string, short: c}
---
$id: output
properties:
  format: {type: string, enum: [json, yaml, csv]}
---
name: fetch
allOf:
  - {$ref: global}
  - properties:
      url: {type: string}
---
name: export
allOf:
  - {$ref: global}
  - {$ref: output}
  - properties:
      file: {type: string}
```

- `$id` schemas (no `name`) are mixins - not registered as subcommands
- `$ref` in `allOf` resolves to mixins in the same file
- Properties are merged; `type: object` is inferred if missing
- Subcommands opt-in explicitly via `allOf`

## Future Ideas

- Man page generation
- Config file generation from schema
- Shell completion for enum values with descriptions
