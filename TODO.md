# TODO

## Completed

- **Mixin isolation and `required` union** (v0.20.1) — `merge_schema` copied a mixin's `properties` hash by reference, so options added to one subcommand after a `$ref` leaked into every other subcommand sharing that mixin (found via camelot). `required` lists are now unioned across mixins and the subcommand's own list instead of first/last-wins. Last-wins `properties` flattening is documented in the README as a deliberate approximation of `allOf`; see "Other Ideas".
- **Consistent positional parsing** (v0.20.0) — variadics are greedy (capture `:`/`=` tokens and negative numbers literally, stop only at a real flag); negative numbers parse as values everywhere (`short_flag?` exempts `-<digit>`); variadic items coerce to the array's `items` type; new `cli.bare_assignment(false)` opt-out for implicit `key:value`/`key=value` assignment. Remaining edges under "Positional Parsing Follow-ups" below.
- **Subcommand descriptions in top-level `--help`** (v0.19.1) — the command list shows each subcommand's `description:`, column-aligned. (transfs req #5)
- **Dynamic shell completions** (v0.19.0) — all-callback shim model; `cli.completer(path)` + `cli.handle_completion`; configurable target binary. See `notes/` and the v0.19.0 release. Remaining edges tracked under "Dynamic Completion Follow-ups" below.
- **POSIX `--` end-of-options passthrough** (v0.19.0) — everything after a bare `--` is a literal positional; variadic positional captures it verbatim. (transfs req #4)
- **`x-*` extension annotations** (v0.18.0) — consumer-defined keys preserved verbatim on `Property#extensions`, ignored by parsing/validation. (transfs req #1)
- **Structural type inference** (v0.18.0) — omitted `type:` inferred from `properties`/`items`; contradictory explicit type now errors instead of silently dropping the block. (bug fix)

### Schema Mixins with $id/$ref/allOf (v0.12.0)

Support for sharing properties across subcommands using standard JSON Schema keywords.

```yaml
---
$id: global
properties:
  verbose: {type: boolean, short: v}
  config: {type: string, short: c}
---
$id: output
properties:
  format: {type: string, enum: [json, yaml, csv]}
---
name: fetch
allOf:
  - {$ref: global}
  - properties:
      url: {type: string}
---
name: export
allOf:
  - {$ref: global}
  - {$ref: output}
  - properties:
      file: {type: string}
```

- `$id` schemas (no `name`) are mixins - not registered as subcommands
- `$ref` in `allOf` resolves to mixins in the same file
- Properties are merged; `type: object` is inferred if missing
- Subcommands opt-in explicitly via `allOf`

## Future Ideas

### Standalone JSON Schema Validator Library

Consider spinning off the validation logic as a separate shard. Jargon already supports:

- Type validation (string, integer, number, boolean, array, object, null)
- `minimum`/`maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`/`exclusiveMaximum`, `multipleOf`
- `minLength`/`maxLength`, `pattern`
- `minItems`/`maxItems`, `uniqueItems`
- `enum`, `const`
- `format` (email, uri, uuid, date, time, date-time, ipv4, ipv6, hostname)
- `$ref` to `$defs`
- `allOf` with local `$id`/`$ref` resolution

To be spec-complete, would need:
- `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `not`
- `if`/`then`/`else`
- `dependentRequired`, `dependentSchemas`

See also:
- https://github.com/aarongodin/jsonschema (dormant since June 2022, has composite schemas but no `$ref` support)
- https://github.com/cyangle/json_schemer.cr (active, Draft 2020-12 compliant, has `$ref` - worth watching)

### Semantic Command Discovery ("Bash Spell Checker")

Use Jargon's JSON Schema definitions as a corpus for semantic search over CLI tools. Natural language → tool call translation without an LLM.

**Concept:**
```
$(repo push) → git push      # high confidence, auto-execute
$(delete old logs) → rm ...  # destructive, confirm first
```

**Techniques:**
- TF-IDF / co-occurrence vectors over tool schemas
- Embeddings over man pages and descriptions
- Salience scoring for match confidence

**Context signals to improve accuracy:**
- Current working directory (git repo? node project?)
- Recent bash history
- Cursor position in IDE/Vim
- Active file types

**Use case:** People who know what they want but forget exact syntax. Acts as a validator/refinement layer for LLM-generated commands - LLM gets close, system finds exact match, gates unsafe operations.

**Not a priority now** - Jargon is the foundation (self-describing tools). This layer can come later. See also: memo, xerp projects.

### Dynamic Completion Follow-ups

Scoped out of the initial dynamic-completion work (v0.19.0). All are refinements, not blockers. Assessed 2026-06-14 — only #2 is judged worth doing.

- **#2 Subcommand abbreviation during completion — WORTH REVISITING.** The completion engine resolves subcommands by exact match only; abbreviations (which `parse` supports — `git ci` → `commit`) aren't expanded when computing candidates. So completing the *args* after an abbreviated subcommand silently yields nothing. Completing the subcommand *name* itself works fine; this is only about arg completion after an abbreviated one. A real correctness gap — the one follow-up actually queued. Fix: have the engine reuse the same prefix-resolution `parse` uses when descending into a subcommand.

- **#3 bash 3.2 portability — will resolve itself.** The generated bash shim uses `readarray`/`mapfile` (bash 4+). macOS ships bash 3.2 as `/bin/bash`, so the shim fails there. But most macOS users have moved to zsh (default since Catalina), and bash 3.2 fades over time. Low urgency; a `read`-loop fallback is the fix if a user actually hits it.

- **#1 Nested-object field completers — SKIP (complexity > payoff).** Completer paths target schema-root fields (flags/positionals) and `subcommand.field`. A flag that is itself a nested object completed via dot notation (`--a.b`) can't have a completer attached to the inner `b`. Rare in practice; the path-resolution and engine changes outweigh the benefit.

- **#4 Streaming/lazy completer results — SKIP (illusory benefit).** Completer blocks return `Array(String)` (proc return type is pinned concretely; the whole engine collects to an array before printing). This is deliberate, not a v1 shortcut — laziness here doesn't actually buy anything:
  - The real goal of "lazy" is *don't enumerate the whole store per keypress*. That's already covered today by scoping the query with `ctx.partial` (`store.search(ctx.partial)`) and/or capping with `.first(N)` — both already return an `Array` that works.
  - There is no streaming completion protocol: the shell needs the full candidate list, so Jargon must `.to_a` before printing regardless. Accepting a raw lazy `Enumerable` would therefore (a) still materialize, and (b) **hang on an unbounded source** — a footgun. The caller has to bound it either way.
  - Candidate sets are inherently small (shells truncate/page at tens–hundreds); no memory-saving scenario exists.
  - Conclusion: `Array(String)` is the correct API, not a limitation to lift.

### Positional Parsing Follow-ups

Edges left after the v0.20.0 parsing work. Neither is a regression; both surfaced
during that work and are low-priority refinements.

- **Double error on a bad variadic item.** A non-coercible variadic token (e.g. `nums 1 oops 3` against `items: {type: integer}`) emits *two* messages: the coercion error (`Invalid integer value 'oops' for vals`) and the validator's type error (`expected Integer, got String`). Consistent with how scalar flags already double up (coerce + validate), so it was left as-is. If it reads as noisy in practice, suppress the validator pass for tokens that already failed coercion. Low priority.

- **`bare_assignment` is per-CLI, not inherited.** The setting applies to a CLI and its directly-attached Schema subcommands, but a *nested* `CLI` keeps its own (default-on) setting. To turn it off across a deep subcommand tree today you must set it on each nested CLI. Fix if it bites: propagate the parent's setting into nested CLIs at parse/dispatch time (or expose a recursive setter). Low priority until a nested-CLI user actually needs it.

### Other Ideas

- Man page generation
- Config file generation from schema
- Shell completion for enum values with descriptions
- Strict `allOf` property intersection — `merge_allof` flattens with last-wins when the same property appears in multiple subschemas; true JSON Schema semantics would intersect the constraints (e.g. both `enum` lists must hold). Low priority, but noted in the README.
